# Instant Teleportation

Teleport without having to sit through a loading screen and wait for cooldowns. Offers a version that affects every teleportation type, a version that affects only dungeon teleporting and a version that has vanilla cooldowns.

Teleporting to distant portals still requires the world to load but teleportation is instant.

Works on both the test branch and the default branch of the game.

Credits to [ElTheLedge](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/users/110405878) for doing it first with their [Faster Teleportation (DISCONTINUED)](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/59?tab=description) mod.
Credits to [GemHunter1](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/users/17885864) for their mod [Fast Teleport](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1774).

I've made this mod because Faster Teleportation isn't working anymore and Fast Teleport doesn't disable the loading screens and cooldowns.
